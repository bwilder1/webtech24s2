		<h3> Slices </h3>
		<p>
			Pinos pizza is a place that offers individual slices. Many people working within the Brighton area come
			here for a quick bite, so it's smart to have slices readily available for people on the go. Once a slice
			is selected, they throw it in the oven to heat it back up to ensure maximum enjoyment. I noticed that many
			of their pizzas include vegetables as toppings, the main ones being olives, tomatoes, and peppers. I have
			had a vegetable slice before, but it's not my go to like a pepperoni slice is. Although I won't be reviewing
			the sicillian, I highly recommend you try their BBQ Chicken sicillian slice, as it is one of my favorites there.
		</p>
		<h3> Review </h3>
		<p>
			I'm going to try to keep this review as one without bias, but it's going to be hard given the
			impact this place has had on my life. I got a fresh pizza so my review conditions can be on par 
			with the others. I got a pepperoni slice, and unlike Pepe's, their pepperoni is sliced wider and thinner.
			I will say it's good, but I prefer Pepe's pepperoni. The best part about this pizza is the cheese to sauce
			ratio, as there will never be a bite with an overwhelming amount of either. The dough was thin and pretty crispy,
			but not as crispy as Pepe's. The crust is by far my favorite with a crunchy outside but soft and doughy inside.
			Overall this pizza is very good, and if you want it in the best condition, get a whole pizza rather
			than a reheated slice, trust me.

		<h3> Final Score </h3>
		<h4> 8.7 </h4>
