		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
			Frank Pepe Pizzeria originated in New Haven Connecticut in 1925. Starting as a small local shop in New Haven,
			Pepe's has grown to be (in my opinion) one of the best pizzerias in the Northeast. One of Frank's first
			jobs was in a bakery, where he mastered the art of baking. The dough used today at Pepe's is the same 
			recipe that Frank used growing up. The dough recipe is a wetter dough that takes longer to ferment, which
			leads to a much richer flavor than ordinary pizza dough. Another aspect that makes their pizzas so delicious
			is the fresh ingredients. For example, the tomatoes used for their sauce come from a hand-picked field on 
			Mount Vesuvius in Naples, Italy. Pepe's is a magnificient pizzeria, so be ready for a good score.
		</p>
		<h3> Pizza Style </h3>
		<p>
			Pepe's takes on a classic neapolitan style of pizza. The oven they use is a 100,000 pound brick oven, and
			it isn't your traditional pizza oven. Pepe's uses bread ovens, yes you heard me right, BREAD OVENS. This
			is because they custom-make a replica of the original oven used by Frank Pepe in each store. Talk about 
			commitment!! Given my lack of baking skills, it's hard to pinpoint the exact difference that it makes,
			all I know is that their pizza is to die for. Each pie comes out with a perfectly even ratio of doughyness to 
			crunchyness, with the crust being the crispiest. Check out the review section to see the score they get!
