		<h3> Slices </h3>
		<p>
			Pepe's offers a standard range of pizzas, nothing like Oath but just around Jinnys and Pinos. 
			Pepe's does not offer singular slices, so I would suggest going with a friend. My go to pizza there 
			is the pepperoni pizza, which I will be reviewing below. I've heard many good things about their White
			Clam Pizza, with the clams coming from the shores of Massachusetts, however you couldn't pay me to
			eat clams, so it's up to you all to provide me with a review of it. The pizzas at Frank Pepe's come 
			steaming hot out of the oven, but when grabbing a slice you don't have to be worried about all the cheese
			falling off. 
		</p>
		<h3> Review </h3>
		<p>
			If you couldn't tell by now, I am deeply in love with Pepe's pizza. Ever since they opened a place in Chestnut Hill,
			which is 3 minutes from my house, I have been going there routinely. My review will be of the pepperoni pizza, but
			I highly encourage you all to try their other options! The smell of this pizza forces its way through your nostrils
			that triggers immediate salivation. The first bite had a crunch that could be heard around the world. The sauce
			was great but the thick cut slices of pepperoni brought it all together. The crust was very crunchy and a little doughy
			which I love. The crunch on this pizza was amazing, and the ingredients seemed to be very fresh. Overall, I 
			would highly recommend everyone come to this place, you won't regret it.

		<h3> Final Score </h3>
