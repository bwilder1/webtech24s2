	<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
	<p>
		Hello, my name is Ben Wilder and I grew up in Chestnut Hill MA.
		I have great parents, two younger siblings that are twins, and two dogs.
		I am currently a Junior at <a href="http://www.babson.edu" target="_blank">Babson</a> and living off campus in Wellesley with some friends.
		I decided to go to Babson because of the Real Estate courses and am currently in one of them.
	</p>
	

	<h2 id="myhobby">My Hobby</h2>
	<p>
		My favorite hobby right now is playing golf.
		I have been playing since I was 6 years old, however during covid I stopped.
		Recently my cousin moved to south carolina so over break I went there and we played every day.
		Now I'm back into it and I'm so glad I started up again, it's a sport I see myself playing for a while.
