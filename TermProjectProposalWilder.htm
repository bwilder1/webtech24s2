	<h3 id="Objective">Objective</h3>
	<p>
		For this term project I plan to inform those who have come to Massachusetts, specifically the Newton
		and Brookline area, of pizza shops that I have personally enjoyed and would recommend. The website I 
		will be creating allows people to read about the different pizza styles and creations offered across those 
		shops along with my go-to items. I plan to do this by writing about 4 different pizza shops, and including sub pages for 
		pictures and my favorite slice from each shop.

	<h3 id="TargetAudience">Target Audience</h3>
	<p>
		The target audience for my website is those who come to the Brookline/Newton area either for work or school
		and are craving a quality pizza.
