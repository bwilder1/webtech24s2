			<td><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">About Me:</span> My name is Ben Wilder, I was raised in Newton, Massachusetts with my loving parents and two younger siblings.
				I also have two cute yet crazy dogs, Gordon and Clementine, that my family adopted a few years ago.
				I went to the Rashi School for middle/elementary then Gann Academy for high school and am currently
				a Junior at Babson pursuing my BSBA with a concentration in real estate. I grew up playing tennis and golf 
				which I still play today, however I've taken a higher liking to golf lately. </td>

			<td>
				<img id="clem" src="Clemmy.jpg" alt="Ben and Dog" title="My cute dog" width="200">
				This is my cute dog Clementine. She's a pitbull that my family adopted in 2023. She's two
				years old and has a mild food addiction, but who doesn't. My mom yelled at me when I let her
				try my slice of pepperoni pizza from Pepes, but she deserved it.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">My Love For Pizza:</span> Some of you may be wondering how crazy I have to be to make a web page on pizza... Well I am.
				I love pizza, and would even consider myself to be a pizza connoisseur. I made this site to 
				help inform people looking for good pizza spots but specifically in the brookline/newton area.
				My hope is that those of you who view the site will then go try those spots and create you own opinion.
				Although we might not agree on toppings, style, or brand, I'm confident that we can agree on loving pizza.</td>
