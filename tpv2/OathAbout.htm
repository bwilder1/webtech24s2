		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
			Oath Pizza is centered around providing healthy and fresh ingredients when making pizza. They have been 
			featured in The Boston Globe, Forbes, and many others for their delicious pizza. They do
			it a little differently than your average pizza shop because of their personal pizzas. The standard
			option is an 11 inch personal pizza that comes sliced into six pieces. To esnure a healthy pizza,
			Oath uses avocado oil, house-made sauce, and hand cut veggies. They have shops in California, Washington, and 
			Massachusetts, but for the sake of this review, I am eating at the Chestnut Hill shop.

		</p>
		<h3> Pizza Style </h3>
		<p>
			Oath has a very interesting pizza style. I wouldn't consider it to be neapolitan because it's too thin, but 
			it's also too thick to be considered St. Louis styled. Oath has a very thin base of dough that's a little crunchy
			but nothing compared to the other reviewed shops. I believe that the use of avocado oil makes it less crunchy,
			which I don't personally like, however, it is a much healthier option than a pizza made with olive oil. I guess
			you could argue that Oath is in it's own category of pizza style given the dough and oil used. As for toppings,
			Oath is kind of Subway styled, where they have many ingredients which you can look at and and choose to add. The
			large amount of options and personal sizing allows for each person to enjoy whatever they want on their pizza.
