		<h3> Slices </h3>
		<p>
			Oath doesn't offer singular slices of pizza given the personal pizza style. What I love most
			about this place is that you can put whatever toppings you want on a pizza. My favorite topping
			to add to their pizza is a balsamic vinegar drizzle. I know that might sound crazy but it gives
			the pizza a flavoring that isn't commonly found. The thin crust pizza is not common especially
			given the places i've reviewed, so I'm curious to see what you all think. 
		</p>
		<h3> Review </h3>
		<p>
			For this review, I got a thin crust pizza but did not personalize it because I want to try one of
			their creations. I'm trying to stick with each pizzerias personal creations because I believe
			those are the ones that are considered "most popular". The pizza I chose was the spicy clucker, it had
			mozzarella, pickled red onions, chicken, siracha, spicy aioli, and scallions. To start, these pizzas are
			definitely made for one person with a potential slice leftover. It is very thin however not super crispy, which
			I'm blaming on the use of avocado oil. The chicken tasted very fresh, which makes sense given their partnership
			Applegate Organics. The crust had a little bit of crunch but still pretty doughy. A big positive is that
			you don't feel an overwhelming sence of fullness that other pizza places will give you, which I also account
			to the avocado oil. Overall a pretty good pizza place, I would recommend it to people looking for a lighter and 
			healthier pizza option.
