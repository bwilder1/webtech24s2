		<br/>
		<h3> Slices </h3>
		<p>
			Jinny's has pretty good variety when it comes to pizzas. Many pizza shops like to use the same 
			ingredients but in different ways so they can create as many pizzas as possible without spending
			money on too many ingredients. Jinny's clearly doesn't do this given the wide array of options. 
			The mezze is a twist of italian and mediterranean cuisine. It is one that might be a little overwhelming
			given the choice of toppings, but I promise you will enjoy it.
		</p>
		<h3> Review </h3>
		<p>
			I'm a big pepperoni pizza fan, but I always find myself putting hot sauce or chili flakes on it to give
			the slice a little extra kick, which makes it seem like Jinnys was reading my mind when they created
			the Picante Pepperoni Pizza. The Picante pizza has an added bonus of hot cherry peppers on top. I ordered
			a slice of that and added Mike's Hot Honey on top (a topping they provide to add some extra spice!). I loved
			the initial crunch that came out of the first bite, classic wood-fired pizza. The sauce was okay, not my favorite
			but still pretty good. The addition of the hot cherry peppers and hot honey really help add some extra flavor
			and spice to the pizza which I loved. The crust was a little too doughy for my liking, my ideal crust would have
			a little more crunch to it. Overall an excellent pizza that I would highly recommend to friends.

		<h3> Final Score </h3>
		<h4> 8.1 </h4>
