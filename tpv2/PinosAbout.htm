		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
			Pinos Pizza was created in 1962 in Brighton Massachusetts, as is owned by Phil Petruzziello and Norman Osmani.
			I hold this place very dear to my heart because I grew up going there. I remember as a kid going to Pinos as a kid,
			and Norman letting me make my own pizza with him. I came to learn that this shop isn't just about pizza, it's
			about community. Pinos is the go-to pizza option for Boston College, and because of that, Pinos plasters several
			posters of BC photos along their wall. They also own the store directly next to them, Eagles Deli. This is for folks
			looking for a more Deli-styled meal, but the best part is you can order pinos and eat it in Eagles with your friends, 
			or vice-versa. If you are considering supporting any of these places, Pinos should be the first one you choose.
		</p>
		<h3> Pizza Style </h3>
		<p>
			Pinos, like the other reviews, takes on a neapolitan styled pizza, however they also offer a very good
			sicillian pizza. Pinos has a relatively thin dough, as compared to Jinnys and Pepes. The crust always is a
			little crunchy on the outside with a soft warm dough on the inside. I really enjoy their sicillian style pizza
			too, even though I normally go for a more crunchy pizza. There's still an outer crunch on that pizza, but it's
			a lot more fluffy, which is different but enjoyable.
